# C.12.1 Health Assessmentᵀᴹ

Under this Benefit, We will provide a Health Assessment of the Insured Person, which can be undertaken in two ways: Digital Health Assessment at home (Section C.12.1.a) or Physical Health Assessment at Our Network Providers / Empanelled Service Providers on a Cashless Facility basis (Section C.12.1.b).

After the results of the Health Assessment are received, a Healthy Heart Score (HHS) will be generated. The results will determine the general risk levels categorised below:

- a. Green & Amber – Your body vitals are in a healthy / acceptable state, and you can begin doing your Activ Days to earn your HealthReturnsᵀᴹ.
- b. Red – Your body vitals are not within the normally acceptable range and you are advised to undergo a regular Health Assessment at your nearest facility for a second round of screening and better health insight.

Note – Based on the Insured Person’s age and clinical condition, We may advise You or the Insured Person for either availing the Digital Health Assessment (Section C.12.1.a) or Physical Health Assessment (Section C.12.1.b) option, whichever is best suitable for You and the Insured Persons covered in Your Policy. The applicability and availability of the Digital Health Assessment will be on sole discretion of the Company. The Company can decide to introduce any new technology in addition or in replacement to the Digital Health Assessment or the Physical Health Assessment or both that can better evaluate the health condition of the Insured Persons(s) and generate a Healthy Heart Score™.

# C.12.1.a Digital Health Assessment (DHA):

- a. Digital Health Assessment generates a Healthy Heart Score™ which indicates your current heart health along with giving you vital health parameters like Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, BMI, Oxygen Saturation, and respiration rate, from the comfort of your home.
- b. Concept: Our system uses signal processing and AI technologies to predict body vitals through a face scan. We analyse pixel intensity changes on the skin using the noncontact rPPG (Remote Photo plethysmography) technique. No physical contact is needed, and you can conveniently check your body vitals at home with just a smartphone, laptop, or tablet and an internet connection.
- c. Steps to undergo Digital Health Assessment:
1. Download and register on the Activ Health Mobile App or register on the ABHI Website.
2. Once logged in, Insured Persons eligible for Digital Health Assessment, will be able to see “Digital Health Assessment" on the Mobile App and Website under the “Book Digital Health Assessment" tab.
3. Answer simple questions related to your health.
4. Submit the response and proceed with a Face Scan.
5. Provide a permission for your device camera access.
6. Start the Face Scan and maintain a steady posture.
7. During the ”Calibration is in progress”, make sure that your face is placed inside the circle shown on the screen.
8. Once calibration is completed, hold the position for at least 30-40 seconds to determine your body vitals. For better results, the surrounding light should be bright and consistent.
9. You can visit the reports section of the Mobile App / ABHI website, to view your assessment reports immediately.
10. Your Healthy Heart Score (HHS) will be generated within an hour from the time of scan and will be valid for a year.
- d. Each Insured Person can avail a Digital Health Assessment once in an active Policy Year. If your scan is unsuccessful due to a technical error, you will be asked to take a re-scan by a message alert on the screen.
- e. Healthy Heart Score (HHS) will be generated after the assessment.
- Note - Digital Health Assessment is for screening purposes only and is not a substitute for the clinical judgment of a health care professional. It is intended to improve your awareness of general wellness. Digital Health Assessment does not diagnose, treat, mitigate or prevent any disease, symptom, disorder or abnormal physical state. Consult with a healthcare professional or contact emergency services if you believe you may have a medical issue.

f. Eligibility for DHA: Digital Health Assessment is made eligible based on certain demographic and clinical criteria.
