# II. Healthy Heart Score (HHS) and its calculation

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in India. The HHS is a simplified scientific tool for the assessment of risk level of CAD over 10 years created on the basis of the individual and multi-factorial risk assessment done by monitoring following medical test based parameters:

|S. No|Parameter|
|---|---|
|1|Age|
|2|Gender|
|3|Total Cholesterol|
|4|Systolic blood pressure|
|5|Smoking Status|
|6|Random Blood Sugar|

# Healthy Heart Score Methodology:

i. Once an Insured person completes the medical test based parameters as given above, the actual value received for these parameters is compared with the cut off value of each parameter. Kindly refer to Annexure A for complete details and illustration.

ii. Based on the actual value received for each tests compared to the cut off value, Individual Points are allocated to each parameter.

iii. The calculated risk score (Sum of individual Points) is then converted into an absolute risk probability in percentage of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) events separately for men and women.

iv. The risk probability estimate is then categorized into Red, Amber and Green for different age and gender.

Kindly refer to Annexure A for cut –off values, complete details and Illustration.

The Healthy Heart Score™ is valid for 12 months, and will automatically be updated based on latest available test result if another Health AssessmentTM is completed.

# III How to calculate Health Returns

Step 1 –The first step in Earning Health Return is to generate Healthy Heart Score. Each Insured Person in the Policy should complete Medical AssessmentTM by undergoing any of the following:

i. Health Assessment (Section C. III. o) during the policy year OR

ii. Health Check Up Program (Section C.II.m)

iii. Pre Policy Medical Check Up before the start of the policy.

Basis the medical assessment, an Insured Person will be categorised into one of the three HHS categories:

1. Red
2. Amber
3. Green

Product Name: Activ Fit (Young Adult Product), Product UIN: ADIHLIP22008V012223.

Once categorised, an Insured Person needs to undergo Physical Assessment as mentioned in Step 2 to earn Health Returns.

# Step 2

Post completion of Medical Assessment, an Insured Person should earn Active Dayz™/ Bonus Active Days, by achieving daily step count goal on monthly basis and/or can achieve fitness level by completing the Fitness Assessment, twice in a Policy Year after a gap of 6 months. The health return accrued post completion of Fitness Assessment will stay applicable every month for next 6 months only. The fitness assessment results will be valid for six months and the best of the fitness assessment result and number of Active Dayz™ will be used in a given month to calculate HealthReturns™. Please refer to Annexure A for Illustration.

# Step 3 - Health Returns Grid

The Insured Person will earn HealthReturns™ based on the Healthy Heart Score™, the fitness assessment result and the number of Active Dayz™ recorded. HealthReturns™ is accrued on a monthly basis according to the following grid.

|No of Active Dayzᵀᴹ in a calendar month OR Fitness Assessment Result*|Healthy Heart Score™| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | |Red|Amber|Green|
|13 or more|Level 5|6.0%|12.0%|30.0%|
|10 – 12|Level 4|3.6%|7.2%|18.0%|
|07—09|Level 3|2.4%|4.8%|12.0%|
|4 – 6|Level 2|1.2%|2.4%|6.0%|
|0 – 3|Level 1|0%|0%|0%|

Note: Please refer Annexure A for Measurement of Fitness Assessment level and Healthy Heart Score Status. In order to achieve a particular level of HealthReturn™, the Insured Person must achieve either the required number of Active Dayz™ or achieve a level (as shown in table above) under Fitness Assessment.
